# Week4 Homework 
## Synopsis 
1. Please write a program that calculates the n th Fibonacci number. The range of number we enter will be 3~90. 
Please use the following series in this problem: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55¡K (Fibonacci number: n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 ,..., 
where n1 +n2 =n3 , n2 +n3 =n4 , etc.) 
2. The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is written n! and is defined as follows: 
¡³ n! = n ? (n ? 1) ? (n ? 2) ? ... ? 1 (for values of n greater than 1) ¡³ n! = 1 (for n = 0 or n = 1).
3. An online retailer sells 5 different products whose retail prices are shown in the following table:  
Write a program that reads a series of pairs of numbers comprise product number and quantity sold for 1 day. 
These 2 numbers are separated by a single space. The series ends with a single 0.Your program should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold for 1 week  
4. Write a program to sort 10 numbers you type. The maximum number we enter will be 100. Please separate each number with 2 spaces. 
5. Write a program that calculates and prints the average of positive integers entered (after 2 decimal places). 
Assume the last value is 0. Please output the average of all the values preceding 0. 
There won¡¦t be limitation on the length of sequence we enter.
6. Write a program that finds the smallest and the largest of several positive integers. If the entered number is 0,
 stop entering number and calculate the smallest and largest number. There won¡¦t be limitation on the length of sequence we enter.
